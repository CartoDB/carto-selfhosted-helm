- All secret references must use the centralized secret association system (`carto._utils.secretAssociation`).
- Support external K8s secrets via `existingSecret` for all secrets.
- Never hardcode secrets, passwords, or tokens in templates or values files.
- All Deployments must include checksum annotations for config and secret changes.
- Only inject the secrets each component actually needs (principle of least privilege).
- Document all secrets and their usage in `values.yaml` and `README.md`.
